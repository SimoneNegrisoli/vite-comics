# Vite DC Comics

## Description:

Create a new project using Vite and Vue 3 and define the components necessary to structure the layout as per the attached screenshot.
When the macroblock structure is ready, populate the menu items dynamically using the component data.
For today we give priority to the structure: when everything is nice and solid, we move on to Sass!

_Font: Open Sans Condensed for title and Open Sans for the rest_

### _Bonuses:_

Create an add-on to manage the blue band with icons.
